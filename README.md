## 🚀 Overview
This project showcases the power of PostgreSQL for analyzing sales data. I worked with a CSV dataset containing sales transactions, created a database table, and used SQL queries to extract valuable business insights.

## 📝 Project Workflow

## 1️ Data Setup
•	📥 Downloaded the sales dataset (CSV file).
•	🛠️ Created the sales table in PostgreSQL using CREATE TABLE.
•	📤 Imported the CSV data into PostgreSQL for querying.

## 2️  Data Exploration & SQL Queries
Once the data was loaded, I applied SQL techniques to analyze business performance.

## ✔️ Basic Queries
•	SELECT – Retrieved relevant sales records.
•	ORDER BY – Sorted sales data by different metrics.

## ✔️ Aggregations & Grouping
•	SUM(total_sale) – Calculated total revenue.
•	AVG(total_sale) – Determined average order value.
•	GROUP BY – Analyzed sales by month, product, and customer.

## ✔️ Advanced SQL Queries
•	RANK() – Identified top-spending customers.
•	TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') – Extracted monthly sales performance.

## 💡 Key Business Insights
Using these SQL queries, I was able to:
✅ Identify top-selling products and slow-moving inventory.
✅ Analyze seasonal trends in sales performance.
✅ Discover high-value customers for loyalty programs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
•	Database: PostgreSQL
•	Query Language: SQL
•	Dataset: Sales transactions (CSV format)

## 📌 Example Query: Monthly Sales Performance
select to_char(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month, 
sum(total_sale) as total_revenue
from sales_data
group by month
order by month;

## 📊 Insight: 
This query helped identify sales trends by month, enabling better forecasting and business strategy.
